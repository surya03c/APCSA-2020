What's up guys.
If you are here, you and I both know that you got FracCalc due soon and you're in a bind to finish the semester out strong. Or you "just need one or two lines of code." Or you are "just lazy and don't want to try on this." Whatever your situation may be, here it is. For all the nit picky CS perfectionists out there, if you find it excessively wordy and convoluted, we had to do this as an early project, so forgive me for the highly simplistic and messy nature of the code. Here it is in all its wretched glory. Good luck and make sure to copy correctly!
