#  Frac Calc Project
The objective of this project is to develop a calculator that can perform basic calculations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Checkpoints of the project were designed such that the calculator tackled increasingly complex tasks as the checkpoints built off each other.
For any questions, comments, or concerns about any aspects of the code, please don't hesitate to email me at surya03c@gmail.com
